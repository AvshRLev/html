                    <td>In my opinion Olive branches are the best weaving materials in israel, they stay flexible for up to a whole month
					from the time you pick them, they are very flexible, they are very strong, they are very easy to come by and 
					you can pick the branches growing from the bottom of the trunk which are the straightest and longest and by that you are actually helping 
					the tree grow better so working with olives is a win win situation</td>

					Date branches are easy to work with, are quite flexible after soaking in water for 24 hours and have a beautiful white yellowish color</td>
                    <td>Are not easy to find out of season if you have'nt collected them on time, Require a 24 hour soak before work and in late years growers in 
					israel have found that growing the Emery dates which has the best branches for weaving is not profitable and are stopping to grow them </td>
