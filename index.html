		<h2> Hey everybody, my name is Avshalom and one of my favorite things to do is make baskets from natural materials
		i collect around where i live</h2>
		<br/>
		<h3>I first started making baskets 18 years ago when i was doing an intructor course with a group called 
		<a href="http://www.shomreihagan.org/">Shomrei Hagan</a> that teaches skills that has to do with
		survival and earth living. One of the skills we learned was basket weaving using palm branches and i fell in love
		immediately and have been weaving ever since.</h3>
		<br/>
		<h3>All the pictures on this website are of baskets hand made by me</h3>

		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h3>I spent many of my years as basket weaver teaching myself and learning from experience and trial and error but a few 
		weavers inspired me along the way and gave me some important lessons i would not have learned without them. All in all i would 
		say that it is good to learn by yourself and experiment but sometimes it really helps to learn from somebody more experienced.
		One of my biggest teachers is Asaf Reshit AKA Asaf Salim, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLoi2g1dKV8BlfsPK5okfsA">his YOUTUBE channel</a>
		 and <a href=" https://www.onlinebasketry.com/">his WebSite </a></h3>
